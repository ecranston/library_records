The code and graphs for my capstone project, involving analyzing records from the Seattle Public Library.

Currently contains python code for exploratory analysis on their ebook checkout records. 
When we look at authors with at least two ebooks, their popularity doesn't vary that much between books.
BUT better statistics would be needed to say something stronger.

For certain authors, like Judy Blume, variations in popularity seem to be caused by a change in genres. 
If we could cluster books based on subject as a proxy for identifying genre, we could use this to improve the predictions.
